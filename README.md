         Frame Synchronization : Global Summation of SOF/PLSC Detectors
1. Frame_detection.pdf document gives the theoritical analysys of the global SOF + PLS.
2. def_G.m defines the construction of Hadamard matrix for PLS.
3. codage.m describes the scrambled pls sequence.
4. channel.m describes the calculation of the received symbols at the receiver.
5. dec_sof_plus_pls_globla.m gives the calculation of the global SOF/PLS summation.
6. frame.m describes the entire end to end process from generating symbols to plotting the ROC curve for the receiver.
